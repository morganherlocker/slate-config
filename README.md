my slate config file for quick window resizing

[slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) is an OSX app for window management. I use it in a very limited way to simply resize my windows to 1/2 left, 1/2 right, 1/2 bottom, or full screen using ctl+cmd+left,right,bottom,up. Copy the .slate file into your ~/ directory with slate installed and it should all work.
